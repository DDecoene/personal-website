# Focus Name Service

I followed the challenge on [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) called [Build your own domain service on a Polygon L2 in a weekend](https://buildspace.so/p/).

For my project I chose the tld `.focus`.

You can mint a domainname and register it on the focus network. Alongside that you can put any content you want in a records field.

The NFT is rendered as an `SVG` file and the data is stored on chain.
