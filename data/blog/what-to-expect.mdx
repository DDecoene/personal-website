# Welcome

Hello and welcome to the blog.

Here I will share my journey as a developer and a software engineer.

I started my journey in the [Software Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) field in the year 1986.
My first computer was a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64). We've come a long way since then.

Currently I'm working on Web3 projects for fun.
